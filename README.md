## Overview
Welcome to the repository for "Data Engineering Design Patterns for High-Volume Data Ingestion in the Cloud." This project is designed to support the findings presented in our paper, which addresses the challenges of data ingestion in enterprise data management. Our proposed design pattern significantly reduces ingestion time and offers two tailored ingestion strategies within a single pipeline.
